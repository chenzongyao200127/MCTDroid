# MCTDroid: Evading Android Malware Detection via Monte-Carlo Tree Search in Zero-Knowledge Settings

## Abstract

The widespread use of Android has made its apps a prime target for cyber attackers. To combat this, detecting malware on Android using machine learning (ML-based AMD) is crucial. However, these methods struggle against adversarial examples, raising significant concerns. Current attacks on ML-based AMD are sophisticated but often rely on unrealistic assumptions about the attacker's knowledge of the system. To address this, we introduce MCTDroid, a novel method that employs the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm alongside a curated Malware Perturbation Selection Pool. This method strategically generates adversarial malware through a process of selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation, effectively evading detection. Tested on public datasets, MCTDroid outperforms existing techniques, offering a more effective way to bypass malware detection.
